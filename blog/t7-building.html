                <h4>What was your experience extending the racer game?</h4>
                <p>It was fun trying to come up with new ideas on how to add new features to make it more interesting. I started out with a long list but had to shorten it down due to time. I felt that this was a lot less stressful than the when first trying to make the game from scratch, probably because I was more confident writing javascript.

                <h4>Did you learn anything while building the calculator?</h4>
                <p>I think paring really helped me complete this assignment. I learnt that bouncing ideas around with people who were in the same position helped me understand the problem and also how to approach the solution. Also when you explain something to another person itâ€™s a way of testing your own knowledge, so this was really helpful when trying to find gaps in my own understanding.
