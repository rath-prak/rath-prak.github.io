						<h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
						<p>Pomodoro Technique and How to create a habit: With Charles Duhigg and Ramit Sethi.</p>
						
						<h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
						<p>I found it interesting that if you begin to create small simple habits then your attitude towards work and learning also begins to change. By setting off the right habits, you could also set off a chain reaction for other good habits. So If you start behaving and acting like a developer, you begin to think like one and the eventually become one.</p>

						<h4>What worked for you?</h4>
						<p>I think it's a little early to gauge which one worked for me, but I have been trying out the â€œHow to How to create a habit: With Charles Duhigg and Ramit Sethi. I have been setting my alarm during tasks and giving myself regular breaks. I plan to track it every week.</p>

						<h4>Which will you experiment with further?</h4>
						<p>How to create habits, Pomodoro and maybe the timebox technique.
