      <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
      <p>EM is a skill and like all skills it can be learnt. Itâ€™s important to not develop intellectual intelligence IQ but multiple forms of intelligence which include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. One of the most important points is that we can train ourselves to have better EM.

      Out of the top six factors that distinguish the engineers from bottom engineers are;
      Strong achievement drive and high achievement standards, ability to influence, conceptual thinking, analytical ability, initiative in taking on challenges, self confidence - four are related to emotional intelligence and the top two are emotional.

      <h4> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
      <p>I definitely felt more relaxed but not sure if I had the right method, I think I will need to give it a few more go during the next week or so and see how if affects why work. Will also try it in different locations.
