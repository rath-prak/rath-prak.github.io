                <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
                <p>EM is a skill and like all skills it can be learnt. Itâ€™s important to not develop intellectual intelligence IQ but multiple forms of intelligence which include self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills. One of the most important points is that we can train ourselves to have better EM. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Out of the top six factors that distinguish the engineers from bottom engineers are;
                Strong achievement drive and high achievement standards, ability to influence, conceptual thinking, analytical ability, initiative in taking on challenges, self confidence - four are related to emotional intelligence and the top two are emotional.
                </p>

                <h4> How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
                <p>I definitely felt more relaxed but not sure if I had the right method, I think I will need to give it a few more go during the next week or so and see how if affects why work. Will also try it in different locations.
