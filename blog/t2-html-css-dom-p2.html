      <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
      <p>Most people view things on a page or screen by first by looking left to right then top to bottom. Grid based design are based on these principles. Most important elements like headings are at the top and less important stuff can be found towards the bottom of the page. Most web pages are designed in this way.</p>

      <h4>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
      <p>People access the web through many different devices from desktops to mobile phones, each device has  different screen sizes. Responsive web design is an approach aimed at making websites fit and viewed optimally across all devices so that content is easily accessed regardless of what device it is being viewed on, compared to the old method of having fixed widths.</p>

      <h4>Semantic structure</h4>
      <p>Giving something a name that has meaning is more useful to the browser or search engine than just giving it a generic name. HTML tags like H1 for a heading or NAV for navigation is more semantic (meaningful) than using the P or DIV tags. Itâ€™s important to structure your HTML as semantic as possible to the browser and search engines process your page efficiently. It will also make it easier for someone else looking at your markup.</p>

      <h4>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</h4>
      <p>Frameworks kick start your project quickly and save you a lot of time. There are many out there and I'm keen to have a play with them, in particular bootstrap.</p>
