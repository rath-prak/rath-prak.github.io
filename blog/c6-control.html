                <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
                <p>I'm not surprised that the book suggest that our lives are usually dictated by our emotions and sometimes it lead us on a path we don't want to go and therefore we feel we have no control over our lives. I have personally felt sometimes this is the case for me.  Fortunately we can train ourselves to control these emotions by trying to master the ability to move from compulsion to choice. 

                Another interesting thing from this chapter were the techniques for dealing with stress. I found the techniques for dealing with emotions relating to “Do Not Feel Bad About Feeling Bad” and “Do Not Feed the Monsters” very interesting and plan to use them next time I get into those situations.  Another interesting point was that if you practice all the techniques for self-regulation it can actually lead to self-confident because you are not controlled by your emotions.</p>
                  
                <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
                <p>I'm not as relaxed as I think I should be, but that would probably come with more practice and also the environment i'm in. I takes a few tries to get relaxed but when I do I can remain focused for about a minute and maintain a good mental state. </p>
