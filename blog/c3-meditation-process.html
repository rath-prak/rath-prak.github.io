                <p class="time">Monday 21st December, 2015</p>

                <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
                <p>I firstly approached this assignment by just jumping straight into skeleton but made kept having to stop and go back and so some research. I then took the approach of not thinking too much about applying skeleton to the website and more time learning  responsive web design and frameworks. Then I applied skeleton to my redesign and found that the process was much simpler and I was able to get the my site responsive. The process over product approach meant that I spent a lot more time learning but make the rebuild process easier. 
                </p>

                <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
                <p>I had tried it a few times in the past but generally didn't have too much interest in it or know much about it other than it was related to certain religions.
                </p>

                <h4> What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h4>
                <p>Meditation can help train your mind to become more relaxed and alert and have the ability to concentrate for longer periods. When your mind is relaxed and alert it leads to calmness, clarity and happiness. Meditation can be compared with physical exercise. When you go to the gym you are training your body to gain the ability to perform better physically. Meditation trains your mind to perform better mentally.
                </p>

                 <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                <p>I think I will try to change my posture, it was interesting to read that you can meditate in any posture as long as you control your breathing and put your mind in the right place.
