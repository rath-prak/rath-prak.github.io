                <p class="time">Sunday 13th December, 2015</p>

                <h4>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p>I found Javascript much more harder to learn than HTML and CSS. Because it was a programming language, many of the concepts new to me and I had to revisit the content and find additional resources and tutorials in order to understand it.

                <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h4>
                <p>Control flow is when you tell the program what order to do things in. An example loops like for or if statement is an example of control flow. They do the same thing over and over again. An Example in everyday life is when you go to sleep every night and wake up every morning. If this process was a loop then we give ourselves instructions to repeat every day like go to sleep at 10pm then wake up at 8:30am. This process will loop(repeat) until we tell the program to stop by giving it a condition like stop these steps on weekends only.
                </p>

                <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals.</h4>
                <p>In short, an array can be described as list and an object is a list of ‘key pairs’. These keys are referred to object properties, think of them as just names. The main difference between accessing data from arrays and objects is when the order of a value or property is important. You should arrays when you want to access in a specific order or you want to loop something. In contrast you use an object for accessing data and sporadically.
                </p>

                <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
                <p>A function is a block of code that can perform multiple tasks. You can think of functions as subprograms inside programs. Functions are helpful because they can bundle multiple instructions into a single instruction (function). Functions are useful when you want to structure larger programs, reduce repetition (DRY code), associate names with subprograms and isolate these subprograms from each other.
