                <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
                <p>I found that if you let someone speak uninterrupted the conversation became more about sharing ideas and more constructive. I practiced â€œmindful conversation with a good friend of mine which I went to school with. Normally when we have a conversation over something we are both passionate about, the conversation turns into an argument and we each try to talk over the other. Both of us found that if we gifted each other 3 mins of speaking time uninterrupted, we were both forced to listen to what the other person had to say which lead to a more constructive conversation and less of an pointless argument. We found it quite interesting  that if you learn to listen to people in a conversation you actually learn more about them and the conversation become more enjoyable. 
                </p>

                <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
                <p>I will definitely use mindful listening as I have already practiced it and it turned out to be very useful. I will also to to practice Looping, which is like active listening and will use it further understand what the other person is trying to say.  Dipping is the most interesting technique for me as, I often notice that I do get distracted by my own feelings and chatter when I engage in a conversation.  So next  I get into an argument or debate I will apply this technique and see how the conversation turns out.
