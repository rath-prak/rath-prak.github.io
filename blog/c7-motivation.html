                <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
                <p>Most people seek happiness through pleasure which is not very sustainable because it can come and go and last for very short periods. We spend most of our lives chasing pleasure falsely believing that it's true happiness and spend less time trying to find a higher purpose which can lead to true and sustainable happiness. People should spend more time finding a higher purpose and less on seeking pleasure.
                <br>
                Most people don't enjoy going to work because the don't have a purpose. The key to enjoying work is to find your own higher purpose, if you know what you value most and what is most meaningful to you and then work towards it. This then becomes a source of sustainable happiness.</p>
                  
                <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise.</h4>
                <p>
                <strong>What are your core values?</strong>
                <br>
                To become financially successful so I can pursue personal projects, maintain a healthy lifestyle, build/make something meaningful and successful. To master a skill, pursue new creative ideas.
                <br> 
                <strong>What do you stand for?</strong>
                <br>
                Honesty, respect and compassion for others. 
                </p>
                <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
                <p>The whole exercise took me about 10mins but felt longer. It was hard maintaining focus during failure and success thought process, I kept skipping from one thought to another, but after a few attempts it was able to concentrate on one thought. When I returned to calm at the end I did feel relaxed and the thoughts I was experiencing earlier were sort of gone.</p>
