      <h4>What is HTML, CSS and the DOM?</h4>
      <p>A website is made out of many components, just like a house. All the elements that are used to make a house like floors, beams, window, roof etc are like the HTML elements in a website - <strong> HEADER, NAV, DIVS </strong> and <strong>BODY</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
      CSS is what gives the house its character, what color is the kitchen, does that house have brick walls or wooden walls. CSS can be applied to a web page using CSS properties like <strong>“font-family”, “background-color”</strong> and <strong>“text-alignment”</strong>. 
     </p>
     <p>
      The DOM is like a map that lets you update and interact with your website, like a key that lets you into your house to make changes and walk around.

      <h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
      <p>Boxifying a design is the process to breaking down a web page into its individual  elements, starting from its parent elements all the way down to its child elements. This can literally be done by drawing boxes around each of the elements until you cover all the elements that make up a web page.</p>

      <h4>What is the Box mode?</h4>
      <p>In CSS, all HTML elements on a web page are wrapped in a box called the ‘box mode’. The box model is made up of the content, padding, border and margins. The size of the box is made up of the content +  padding +  border + margin.</p>
