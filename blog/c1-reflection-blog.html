			<h4>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?</h4>
			<p>For someone like myself who has been working as designer for many years but has little knowledge of coding and wants to move into web development  - DBC/EDA seems like a good option. Its much shorter than the more lengthy degrees and course that may take years to complete. The learning methods and philosophies are also different and exciting. Students are encouraged to take control of their own learning as well as work together in order learn more efficiently and solve problems. EDA allows people who want to make a transition in their career/life to take that leap and not just toy around the the idea without taking any action.</p>
			
			<h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
			<p>After the first week with EDA, I have learnt things that were not directly related to coding but will be valuable in becoming a good developer. The weekly assignments/tasks motivates you to regularly learn and work towards specific goals and deadlines.  This suits my learning style because I am easily distracted if I don’t have deadlines to work towards. I also like the fact that bootcamp is on campus which forces you to commit and learn even when you don't feel like it. The approach that everyone is in it together is also comforting. One of my concerns coming into this course was not being able to cope with the really hard stuff, but I know if I struggle with the material, I will be given support from my fellow classmates and teaching staff.</p>

			<h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
			<p>I think this team culture will suit me well, I have played a lot if team sports and enjoy this kind of interaction. I also look forward to bootcamp where you get a chance to work on projects with others, something I don't do often with my previous jobs.</p>

			<h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
			<p>My expectation before I started EDA was that it was going to be a lot of hard work and really challenging but worthwhile even if I just scrape through. Coming from a design background and never really coded before, I was a bit concerned about whether I could cope with the material, especially in the later stages of the course and bootcamp. But after reading some of the material, watching Shereef’s video and talking to the tutors during orientation I feel a little more comfortable. I still expection it to be tough but worth it.</p>

			<h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? <br> Does it make you nervous?</h4>
			<p>yes I'm very excited and yes a little nervous.</p>
