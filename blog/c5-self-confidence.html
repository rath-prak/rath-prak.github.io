                <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                <p>Daniel Goleman defines  “Self-awareness as a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions.” Where as Jon Kabat-Zinn defines mindfulness as “Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally.” Both are aim to control emotion so they are essentially the same. Both are trainable.
                </p>

                <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).</h4>
                <p>I tried Journaling, I wrote a journal for 3mins before I went to sleep using three prompts:  What motivates me is, I am inspired by, Tomorrow, I aspire to.
                </p>

                 <h4>What was your experience of it?</h4>
                <p>I actually quite enjoyed it, what I found was that I was about things that I had already thought about and things that I didn't think would inspire me. Also when I woke up in the mornings I still had the thoughts from the previous night still in my head.
                </p>

                <h4>How did you feel?</h4>
                <p>I felt a little more motivated. 
                </p>

                 <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</h4>
                <p>Being self confident is not about have a big ego or overestimating your abilities,  its about reaching inside yourself and being aware of ones strengths and weakness and being able to control them.
                </p>
