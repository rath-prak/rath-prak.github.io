                <p class="time">Sunday 23rd January, 2016</p>

                <h4>Got blocked on a simple problem</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>What was the problem?<br>
During the Udacity resume builder I struggled at first to apply the proper Jquery to the heading and page didn't display properly.</p></li>
                  <li>
                   <p> What problem solving techniques did you use?<br>
I used a combination of trying something/experimenting, console.log to find any obvious errors and googling stuff on Jquery.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>How did you feel throughout the process?<br>
Its very frustrating when you make little or no progress but when I finally solved the problem I felt really great and it gave me extra energy and motivation to move on to the next stage and finish the project.</p></li>
                  <li><p>What did you learn?<br>
Programming is about perseverance, for a beginner, it will be very challenging at first but you have to keep at it. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>What was the problem?<br>
What was the problem?</p></li>
                  <li>
                   <p>What problem solving techniques did you use?<br>
A combination of googling and reflection. I found that by revising and reflecting on the material I was able to improve my code.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><p>How did you feel throughout the process?<br>
I felt confident and looked forward to learning more. </p></li>
                  <li><p>What did you learn?<br>
The less code you use when solving a problem the better. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li><p>Pseudocode - Only tried it a few times and was not sure if I did it right. This is one technique that I will try to work on as I know it's a very valuable tool for problem solving.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Trying something - This is always my first instinct but it doesn't always work.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Rubber ducky method - Never tried this method before.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Reading error messages - Something I have been doing more and more lately in chrome. I find this is really helpful when you don't know where to start looking when your program has errors.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Console.logging - Don't really use this technique but as with Pseudocode, I plan to start using it more.
                  </p></li>
                  <li><p>Asking your peers for help - Don't use this technique that often, but I think once the material gets harder, this will be a valuable tool.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Asking coaches for help - Only ask if I'm really stuck.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Improving your process with reflection - Confident. I find this technique useful especially when the concepts are new.</p></li>
                </ul>  

                 <h4>Explain to your non-tech friend</h4>
                <p>.map() - This method is similar to the .length method. It basically goes through all the elements in an array then creates a new array with modified values.</p>

                <p>.filter() - This method goes through an array and returns any value that meets a certain condition.</p>

                <p>.reduce() - This method takes two arrays and joins them into a single array by summing up all the value in the array and returns a new single array.</p>

                <h4>Recursion VS Iteration</h4>
                <p>Both processes are very similar in that both in that both solve problems by repeating a certain task. Iteration repeats a process x amount of times until it reaches a certain target. Recursion is the process of breaking the problem up into smaller pieces until you can solve it.  
                </p>
